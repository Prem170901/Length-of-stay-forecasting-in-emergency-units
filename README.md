Perforing Univariate and bivariate analysis with plots on the healthcare data to understand the data .
Then performing data processing & feature engineering 
Then preparing the data model by spliting train ,test data 
Comparing the data against linear and non-linear regression models 
For linear models : Linear Regression and ridge regression is used
For Non-Linear models:Bagging ,Decision Tree , Random Forest Aand Tuned Random forest with grid serach are used
The metrics used for comparision amoung the folowing models are:RMSE,MAE,R-Squared
Then using the best model to make predictions 
At last making use of SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) for explaining how each predictions influence the overall output
